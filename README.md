# ML_Projects Repository

Welcome to the `ML_Projects` repository, a collection of independent machine learning projects focusing on diverse applications and methodologies. Each project within this repository is self-contained and explores different aspects of machine learning, from conversion rate optimization and unsupervised learning techniques to predictive modeling for retail sales. Below is an overview of the projects included in this repository.

## Projects Overview

### 1. ML_Conversion_Rate

* **Description** : This project aims to optimize website conversion rates by applying various machine learning techniques. By analyzing user actions and characteristics, we develop models to predict and influence future user conversions.
* **Technologies Used** : Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn
* **Repository Link** : https://github.com/YoussefMrbt/ML_Conversion_rate

### 2. ML_Unsupervised_Uber

* **Description** : Leveraging unsupervised learning methods, this project focuses on analyzing Uber trip data to uncover patterns, optimize ride-sharing operations, and improve overall service efficiency.
* **Technologies Used** : Python, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, KMeans Clustering
* **Repository Link** : https://github.com/YoussefMrbt/ML_Unsupervised_Uber

### 3. ML_Walmart

* **Description** : This predictive modeling project targets retail sales forecasting for Walmart. Using historical sales data, the project applies machine learning algorithms to forecast future sales and analyze factors influencing sales trends.
* **Technologies Used** : Python, Pandas, TensorFlow, Time Series Analysis
* **Repository Link** : https://github.com/YoussefMrbt/ML_Walmart
